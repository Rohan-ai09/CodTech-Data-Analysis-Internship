Objective:
Build a regression or classification model to predict outcomes.

Dataset:
Titanic Dataset (from Kaggle)

Key Steps:
1. Preprocessing:
  -Handled missing values in Age and Embarked.
  -Categorical encoding using pd.get_dummies.
2.Model Building:
  from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
  from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
  from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

  X = data.drop("Survived", axis=1)
  y = data["Survived"]

  X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

  model = RandomForestClassifier()
  model.fit(X_train, y_train)
  predictions = model.predict(X_test)
  print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, predictions))
3. Results:
  Accuracy: ~85%
  Feature importance showed Sex, Pclass, and Fare were top predictors.
